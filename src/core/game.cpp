  // The order systems is very important in an ECS.
  // Each system reads some state and modifies some state.
  // If the state isn't read and modified in the right order,
  // subtle bugs can occur. Make sure that the order of systems is easy to see.
  // i.e. not hidden away by some abstraction that sets the order for you.
  // Always think carefully about the order that systems should be in.

  // It's OK to keep some game state outside of the ECS. e.g. maze, dots, dotSprite
  // But try to keep as much state within the ECS as you can though.
  // Keeping too much state outside of the ECS can lead to problems. For example:
  // `dots` is the amount of dots eaten by the player. If there were more than
  // one player, then each player might want to keep track of how many dots
  // they've eaten. So `dots` would have to be moved into a component
