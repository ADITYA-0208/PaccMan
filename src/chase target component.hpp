// These components define the chase targeting behavior for each ghost

// This is where the beauty in ECS comes in
// Blinky doesn't have to chase the player!
// The BlinkyChaseTarget component stores the ID of an entity that
// has a Position component. That's it! Blinky can chase anything
// that has a Position. We could quite easily make blinky chase inky
