The wall collide system should determine whether a given entity can move in some direction.
The player_input system uses this information to set desiredDir.
The pursue_target system also uses this information to set desiredDir.
Currently, the player_input system has not knowledge of whether an inputed direction is valid.
The pursue_target system only accounts for walls and not the door to the ghost house

There might need to be systems for making the ghosts enter and leave the house.
Ghosts leave the house based on how many dots the player eats.
Ghosts enter the house after being eaten.

Ghosts must have the EnterHouse component to be allowed to enter. Same for the LeaveHouse
component. The enter/leave components act like a ticket that can be used once.
Upon leaving or entering, the component is removed.
